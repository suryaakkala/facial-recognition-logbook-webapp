# Facial Recognition Logbook Web Application

A modern web-based attendance system that uses **facial recognition** to automate and streamline attendance logging. The application is built with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **face-api.js**, providing a secure, contactless, and efficient alternative to traditional manual or biometric methods.

## 🚀 Features

- **Admin Authentication**
  - Secure login with JWT-based session management
  - Admin dashboard for system management

- **User Management**
  - Register new users with profile image
  - Face encoding generated and stored using `face-api.js`
  - Manage and delete existing users

- **Attendance Management**
  - Real-time face recognition via webcam
  - Automatic attendance marking with confidence scores
  - View, edit, or delete attendance records by date

- **System Security**
  - JWT for authentication
  - Supabase storage for profile images
  - Input validation to prevent duplicate or invalid registrations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database & Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)
- **Face Recognition**: face-api.js (TensorFlow.js-based models)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Admin Login** – Admin authenticates securely via the login portal.
2. **User Registration** – Admin uploads a user’s profile image → face encoding is extracted → user data is stored in Supabase.
3. **Face Scanning** – Users appear in front of a webcam → system detects and matches face with stored encodings.
4. **Attendance Marking** – If a match is found, attendance is logged with timestamp and confidence score.
5. **Admin Dashboard** – Admins can view daily logs, update records, and manage user/admin accounts.
